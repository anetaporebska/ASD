Proszę podać algorytm dla najdłuższego podciągu rosnącego o złożoności nlogn.

In general, we have set of active lists of varying length. We are adding an element A[i]
to these lists. We scan the lists (for end) elements) in decreasing order of their lenght.
We will verify the end elements of all the lists to find a list whose end element is smaller
than A[i]

1. If A[i] is smallest among all end candidates of active lists, we will start new active
list of length 1.
2. If A[i] is largest among all end candidates of active lists, we will clone the largest
actual list and extend it by A[i].
3. If A[i] is in between, we will find a list with largest end element that is
smaller than A[i]. Clone and extend this list by A[i]. We will discard all other lists of
same length as that of this modified list.


Remember to maintain the condition: "end element of smaller list is smaller than
end element of larger list"
