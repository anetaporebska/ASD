We initialize distances to all vertices as infinite and distance to source as 0, then we find a topological sorting of
the graph. Topological Sorting of a graph represents a linear ordering of the graph
Once we have topological order (or linear representation),
we one by one process all vertices in topological order. For every vertex being processed,
we update distances of its adjacent using distance of current vertex.
