"""
Horn-SAT

If the formula contains a clause composed of a single literal l then all clauses containing l are removed
and all clauses containing ~l have this literal removed.
If there are no unit clauses, the formula can be satisfied vy simply setting all remaining variables negative.
The formula is unsatisfiable if this transformation generates a pair of opposite unit clauses l and ~l.
