LeetCode Jump Game I
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
Determine if you are able to reach the last index.


Greedy O(n)
The idea is to work backwards from the last index. Keep track of the smallest index that can "jump" to the last
index. Check whether current index can jump to this smallest index.
